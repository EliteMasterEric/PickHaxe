# mappings

This folder doesn't actually contain any Minecraft mappings, but rather information ABOUT mappings, as well as things like required JDK and Gradle versions.

HxCraft tries to stick to Mojmap when possible, but for older versions other mappings are needed.

Most popular versions are 1.7.10, 1.12.2, and 1.16.5. Latest is 1.19.3 and oldest is Beta 1.7.3.
