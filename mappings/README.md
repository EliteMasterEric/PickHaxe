# mappings

This folder doesn't actually contain any Minecraft mappings, but rather information ABOUT mappings.

HxCraft tries to stick to Mojmap when possible, but for older versions other mappings are needed.

# Available Mappings
- [Parchment](https://parchmentmc.org/docs/getting-started)
- [Yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn)
- [MCP](https://files.minecraftforge.net/de/oceanlabs/mcp/mcp_config/) plus [Archive](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/MCP-Archive)
