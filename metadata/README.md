# metadata

Stores static data (just the stuff that can't be retrieved via API).

This includes things like what Gradle version is needed for Fabric and Forge.

**NOTE:** Most popular versions for modding are 1.7.10, 1.12.2, and 1.16.5. Lastest (1.19.3 at time of writing) is less popular, oldest with available tooling is Beta 1.7.3, and other versions are "stretch goals."

**NOTE:** Almost none of these values are used when processing Fabric, since all of them are accessible via APIs.
